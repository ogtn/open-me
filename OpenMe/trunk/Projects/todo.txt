======[High priority]======
-Mesh and vertex attribute finalizing mechanism

======[Normal priority]======
-FPS Camera (angles and position)
-Batch
-Compute AABBox for entity
-Compute normals
-Mesh optimiser
	->compute index
	->avoid redundancy
	->turn quads into triangles?
-Generated shaders depending on the mesh?
	->Regeneration when changes occurs
	->Find a way to allow integration of users shaders in it
-Skyboxes/ skydomes
-Octree
-Screenshot
-Sprites
-Text
-Image as resource instead of texture?
-Add model, wich are made of meshes, wich are made of geometry, wich are resources?

======[Low priority]======
-Plugin interface
-Mesh transformers
